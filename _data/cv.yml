      position: Researcher, Xihong Lin laboratory
      year: 09/2022 - present
      description:
        - Developing robust polygenic risk scores (PRS) for early disease diagnosis and reliable patient stratification, leveraging mixed effects model framework. Our method correctly accounts for longitudinal data and cryptic/familial relatedness.
        - Validating method via simulation and empirically using UK Biobank data to show that predictions produced are consistently more accurate than current state-of-the-art approaches.

      description:
      - Developed and tested AMR (antimicrobial resistance) machine learning (ML) identification pipeline for metagenomic diagnostic samples.
      - Developed unsupervised ML model to predict AMR from protein structural disruptions in protein variants. AlphaFold was leveraged for protein structure prediction and de novo AMR gene discovery.

      position: Researcher, David Kwiatkowski laboratory
      year: 09/2020 - 04/2022
      description:
      - Led broad scientific mission to unravel the genomic landscape of a rare, aggressive tumor type known as PEComa and provide diagnostic markers (extensive experience analyzing WES/WGS, RNA-seq, and ChIP-seq data).
      - Co-authored 5 manuscripts reporting new somatic genetic events (SNVs, indels, CNVs) and mutational signatures that contribute to the development and progression of malignant PEComa with metastatic potential. 

    - title: Preverna
      position: Data Scientist, Computational genomics
      year: 06/2021 - 05/2022
      description:
      - Built end-to-end machine learning pipeline to identify kinase drug targets and extract relevant features from multi-omics (e.g. proteomic) data associated with disease onset, progression, and survival for several cancer types.  
      - Identified novel biomarker candidates to support drug discovery using in-house and publicly available datasets.  
      - Continually presented methods to internal and external stakeholders and made a case for advancing discoveries from in-silico to in-vitro and in-vivo trials.

      description:
      - Developed multi-omics machine learning model to predict Alzheimer's disease (AD) onset and progression from genetic (XGBoost), neuroimaging (3D CNN), and clinical data (MLP) to facilitate rapid and precise diagnosis.
    
    - title: Harvard Medical School
      position: Research Intern, Debora Marks laboratory
      year: 06/2019 - 04/2020
      description:
      - Selected as one of 82 students around the world to conduct research at the RSI 2019 program.  
      - Integrated publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing data sets to investigate differentiation pathways and cell fate determination signals. Explored effects of simultaneous biological systems on fate decision-making during differentiation by modeling organelle development relative to cell development. 
    
    - title: Lawrence University
      position: Researcher, Brian Piasecki laboratory
      year: 09/2017 - 06/2018
      description:
      - Studied evolutionary behavior of bacteria in antibiotics and Manuka honey. Characterized the bactericidal properties of honey and the role of osmotic stress. Modeled genetic basis and patterns of gaining antibiotic resistance.
