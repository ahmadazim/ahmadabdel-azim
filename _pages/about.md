I am driven to apply computational and statistical techniques to advance the prospect of <span class="font-weight-bold">precision medicine</span> and design <span class="font-weight-bold">patient-tailored therapies</span> for the treatment of human diseases. Toward that goal, I have worked as a researcher and intern at several academic labs, companies, and pharmaceutical startups. At Harvard, I am currently pursuing an <span class="font-weight-bold">A.B./A.M. concurrent degree</span> in statistics and molecular & cellular biology. 

This website is a collection of my <span class="font-weight-bold">[projects]({{ '/projects/' | relative_url}}{{ site.projects_nav_title }})</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">[professional experiences]({{ '/cv/' | relative_url}}{{ site.cv_nav_title }})</span>. I also write about various topics in statistics and deep learning <span class="font-weight-bold">[here]({{ '/blog/' | relative_url}}{{ site.blog_nav_title }})</span>!
